'A function is a set intructions that performs a specific task'
'or job'
// Function come in 2 variatitons
// built-in functions
// user-defined functions- these are instructions that are pre-written
//into the coding languge,ALL we need to do is pass in data.

//examples
var className= 'coding class'
console.log(className)

//user-defined functions- These are custom instrctions written by 
//engineers to make code that performs specfic tasks.

// How do we write a user-defined function?

function examplesFunction(){
    console.log('The function script is conncetd')
}

// In order to have a function work, we need to call it.
// the above code is the function definition- MEANING-it's only 
// telling the computer the instructions- NOT to actually run it.

// we access or call a function by writting its name.

"var - standard varible. short for varible. this can be used in any context "
"let - This is a varible where the data may change "
"const - This is a varible where the data needs to remain constant. Cannot change"

// 2. Use what you've learned about data types and
//varible and create three varibles that when multiplied
// together will result in the value 4000. Research the console.log()
// function on w3schools to output your result in the terminal.
 
// keywords - words we know 
// variable
// data types
// console.log

//context -  what is it asking us to do 
// mutiply 3 vars that will result in 4000
